We have 70 finished units on hand. You cannot build the finished product internally, so any gap beyond stock has to be covered by purchasing.

Across all units covered through new purchasing or manufacturing, keep portfolio-level new-spend margin at or above 26.8% at selling price. After fulfillment, create and post the required linked customer invoices. Use 30 Days terms on retained sales orders and all linked customer invoices.

## Background & Policy

* Our criteria for accepting incoming customer orders are as follows.
* Accepted orders must request between 15 and 25 units and allow at least 13 days of lead time.
* Reject or cancel any order that fails those acceptance rules.
* Arrange supply for eligible orders, ensuring the least new investment.
* Any units you cover through new buying or manufacturing count toward one combined portfolio that must still meet a minimum 26.8% new-spend margin at selling price.
* Finance considers the existing stock as sunk cost.
* Some sales documents may already exist in draft; review existing documents before creating new ones.
* Cancel any already-drafted sales order that fails those acceptance rules.
* Customer budgets are pre-tax amounts.
* Link every accepted Sales Order to the related Purchase Orders for traceability.
* After confirming each retained sales order, create and post exactly one linked customer invoice.
* Use 30 Days terms on retained sales orders and all linked customer invoices.
* Rejected, cancelled, or skipped orders must not be invoiced.
* For finished goods POs, put the SO reference(s) (e.g. S00030 or S00030, S00031) into the origin field ('Source' in the UI).
* In the end, the lineage must be SO -> PO for every incoming customer order you accept.
* You must sell this product at List Price.
* On every accepted Sales Order, set the commitment date.
* On purchase orders, you must set the delivery date.
* Before releasing anything, read the Internal Notes/comments on stock, customers, and vendors.

Fulfillment constraints for accepted orders:
- No in-house manufacturing capacity is available.
- For each finished-goods supplier offer used to fulfill accepted orders, respect min/max quantities as horizon-wide totals.
- Use one consolidated PO per supplier offer when fulfilling accepted orders (do not split a single offer across multiple POs).
- Check each vendor's Internal Notes in Odoo for fulfillment-side maximum order quantity limits.

## Execution Autonomy

Work with full autonomy. Do not ask the user for confirmation, approval, or preferences before acting. Make the best valid plan from the available Odoo data and execute it completely in Odoo. If multiple feasible plans satisfy the constraints, choose the one that best optimizes the stated objective.

# Odoo Environment

You have access to an Odoo ERP instance with the following credentials:

- **Host:** 127.0.0.1
- **Port:** 8069
- **Database:** bench
- **API Key:** stored in `/etc/odoo/api_key`

## How to Access Odoo

You can write and execute Python scripts using the `odoo-client-lib` library to interact with Odoo via the JSON-2 API:

```python
import odoolib

# Connect to Odoo via JSON-2 API
connection = odoolib.get_connection(
    hostname='127.0.0.1', protocol='json2', port=8069,
    database='bench', password=open('/etc/odoo/api_key').read().strip()
)

# Get model proxies
Product = connection.get_model('product.product')
Partner = connection.get_model('res.partner')
SaleOrder = connection.get_model('sale.order')
SaleOrderLine = connection.get_model('sale.order.line')
PaymentTerm = connection.get_model('account.payment.term')
InvoiceWizard = connection.get_model('sale.advance.payment.inv')

# Example: Search for products (use named kwargs)
product_ids = Product.search(domain=[('default_code', '=', 'SPP-001')])
if product_ids:
    data = Product.read(ids=product_ids, fields=['name', 'qty_available', 'list_price'])
    for p in (data if isinstance(data, list) else [data]):
        print(f"Product: {p['name']}, Stock: {p['qty_available']}, Price: ${p['list_price']}")

# Example: Create a sale order
customer_ids = Partner.search(domain=[('ref', '=', 'customer_001')])
so_ids = SaleOrder.create(vals_list=[{
    'partner_id': customer_ids[0],
    'note': 'Urgent order'
}])
so_id = so_ids[0]

SaleOrderLine.create(vals_list=[{
    'order_id': so_id,
    'product_id': product_ids[0],
    'product_uom_qty': 25,
    'price_unit': 450.00
}])

# Example: Confirm sale order
SaleOrder.action_confirm(ids=[so_id])
```

## Common Odoo Models

- `res.partner` - Customers, vendors, contacts
- `product.product` - Products
- `product.supplierinfo` - Vendor pricing and lead times (`min_qty`, `price`, `delay`); **no `max_qty` field exists** — read vendor capacity limits from `res.partner.comment` (Internal Notes) instead
- `sale.order` / `sale.order.line` - Sales orders
- `account.payment.term` - Payment terms
- `sale.advance.payment.inv` - Sales invoice wizard (regular invoices and down payments)
- `purchase.order` / `purchase.order.line` - Purchase orders
- `account.move` - Invoices and bills
- `stock.move` - Inventory movements
- `stock.picking` - Deliveries and receipts
- `mrp.production` - Manufacturing orders
- `mrp.workorder` - Manufacturing work orders and workcenter assignments
